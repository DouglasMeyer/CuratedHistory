 * [github.com/DouglasMeyer.private.atom](https://github.com)

   For someone who actively uses RSS, I can't believe I haven't subscribed to my private github feed. Just head over to [github](http://github.com) and run `$$('link[type="application/atom+xml"]')[0].getAttribute('href');` in the JS console, and it'll give you a link to your private feed.

 * [6 Dangerous Ways to Cook an Egg - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpSbHuv5vFA&feature=youtu.be)

   This guy definitely has the "Look at this dangerous thing" vibe.

 * [Prison Architect - Max Sec Only! - Episode 1 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YWZGCJ-IXE)

   Fun game, with a Dwarf Fortress feel. Speaking of which, I should checkout [The Lazy Newb Pack](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:Lazy_Newb_Pack) to try Dwarf Fortress again.

 * [Numbers with Meaning - Numberphile - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7E-pBWuSIA)

   Nerdy YT channel, but this video touches on an amusing psychological issue.

 * [Looking glass - Brandi you're a fine girl - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-tRXewCAmU)

   Had this song stuck in my head.

 * [XCOM 2 Announcement Trailer - "Moment of Truth" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RonqT9ZWLdk)

   I'm a big fan of the xcom series, even though I've hardly played the latest games.

 * [Inside the ant colony - Deborah M. Gordon - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG-QZOTc5_Q&index=1&list=WL)

   I've always been fascinated by ants. This is a neat glimpse into their behavior.

 * [Naked Eyes - Promises, Promises (HQ) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBupia9oidU)

   Every time I give some thought to JS Promises, I get this song stuck in my head.

 * [feat(Promise support): Support using Promises in async tests. by briandipalma - Pull Request #696 - jasmine/jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/pull/696)
 * [Why is Jasmine used as default instead of Mocha? - Issue #117 - yeoman/yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/117)

   Speaking of promises, I was really we could have awesome JS tests in jasmine with ES7 async functions. But it looks like they aren't all too interested. Looks like mocha already supports promises. I'll have to jump over to mocha, jasmine's async support is a mess.

   Warning pop-ups! But it does a good job of syncing 2 youtube videos.

   A good episode if you are amused by decentralized file sharing.
