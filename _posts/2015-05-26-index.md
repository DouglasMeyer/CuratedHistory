 * [Erlang: The Awesome Movie - YouTube](https://youtu.be/qyVvGjNjBOA?t=196)

   Someone pointed me to this video, a long time ago, as the definitive introduction to erlang. Probably not an accurate description of it, but an amusing introduction. For some reason, I am very amused by the conference call of this video.

 * [The High Line - Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.744992,-74.006797,3a,75y,24.93h,81.92t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s_EwGHy0zuOZkgoUYzGSaQQ!2e0!3e5!6m1!1e1)

   My son went on a walk on The High Line. Ever since he heard the High Line is a park created from an old rail line, Calvin keeps asking to go to New York to play there.

   Might have to play-around with with [Web Audio API - Web API Interfaces \\| MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)

 * [Roman Mars: Why city flags may be the worst-designed thing you've never noticed \\| Talk Video \\| TED.com](http://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed)

   Quite a good listen. I'm not sure if I say that because I'm amused by design, or it is actually an entertaining talk :)

 * [Animation: "Pipe Dream," AniMusic (2011) - Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2015/05/25/animation-pipe-dream-ani.html)

   Anyone remember this one? Kids love the visuals.

 * [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/)

   For some reason, my son was running around dark rooms with a flashlight saying he was "spelunking". So, I asked him if he wanted to see a spelunking game. He loves it, and we are making a water mob trap.
