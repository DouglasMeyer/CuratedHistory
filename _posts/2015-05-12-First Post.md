 * [Doug's Curated Browsing History](http://127.0.0.1:4000/CuratedHistory/)

   I guess the most appropriate record to start my Curated History post with is me working on the Curated History site in development :)

   * [pow not work when not connected to the network on Yosemite - Issue #471 - basecamp/pow](https://github.com/basecamp/pow/issues/471)

     And naturally, I run into issues with using pow when on the train.

   * [chrome.history - Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/history)

     Don't worry, I'm not getting my history manually :)

   * [sending message to chrome extension from a web page - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11431337/sending-message-to-chrome-extension-from-a-web-page)
   * [Side Comments - Medium.com style commenting](http://aroc.github.io/side-comments-demo/)

     I'm going to want to get comments in here soon. Let me know what all 2 of you think.

   * [Extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com/!#{"modules":["hidden-mode","with-js-bg","no-options","no-override"],"boolean_perms":["history"],"match_ptrns":["http://www.Douglas-meyer.name/*","http://localhost:4000/*"]})

     The quick/lazy way of starting a chrome extension.

 * [Feedly](http://feedly.com/i/latest)

   My RSS feeds are basically a permanent tab. Most of what I'm subscribed to is WebDev and News.

 * [Resume: Venice and the Ottoman Empire: Crash Course World History #19](http://resumeplaylist.com/?list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9)

   This one is basically a double. resumeplaylist.com is a handy way to save your spot in a youtube playlist. And I listen to Crash Course World History to try to get familiar with how we got where we are on this ball in space. Not sure how much I retain from the high-energy videos.

 * [Ruby5](https://ruby5.codeschool.com/)

   A good podcast on what is happening in ruby.

 * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DouglasMeyer)

   I'm going to try to post more often on Twitter. But right now, it is mostly a bunch of automated running posts.

 * [Agar.io](http://agar.io/)

   This is probably my favorite type of game. The kind that is easy to get into, and I feel like I could make it myself.
